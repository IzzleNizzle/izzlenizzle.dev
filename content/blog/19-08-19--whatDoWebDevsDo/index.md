# Vision - Creation Time Lapse

When I first got my new job as a web developer, I thought it was pretty cool creating new pages and I though that a good time lapse would be fun to watch. 

Well my video editing skills are not as high as others, but I gave it a good effort. I recorded my screen when I was given an assignment to create a new page and then after some time I put it together in a little video I posted on the youtubez.

There are many different kinds of web development, and this is only a small piece of what one may do. But I think it's insightful anyways.

For this assignment I'm basically creating a landing page from HTML and CSS, nothing more. It's a simple assignment, but creating something from scratch nonetheless.
